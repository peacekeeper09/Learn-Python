# Learn Python - A simplified documentation on Python.

Hello folks, you can call me PEACE. As you can see the heading, this is an unofficial, simplified documentation for Python, for beginners. In this repository, I have tried to explain Python as simple as possible. So without wasting any more time, let's begin!

## **Python**
**What is Python ?** 

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. In sort, it's an easy programming language that one can learn. It's readability is way better as compared to any other programming language out there. Also the Python community is so helpful, healthy and active.  I believe this is all you need to know about Python(summary ofcourse).

## **Python VS**
**Now let's begin to compare python with other programming language(s).**\
I will be comparing Python only with Java, Javascript, C++, C and Pearl here.

****VS JAVA****\
Runs slower as compared to Java but at the same time Python also takes less time to 
to develop.Usually a python program is 3 to 5 times smaller when compared to Java.

****VS JAVASCRIPT****\
Python's "object-based" subset is roughly equivalent to JavaScript. Like Javascript, Python uses simple language unlike putting everything under class.

****VS PERL****\
Both kinda comes from same background, [unix scripting](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/shell_scripting.htm) and do share many similarities despite having a different philosophy. Like both do have different purpose but yet they share some similiarities.

****VS C++****\
This comparision will be somewhat similar to Python VS Java. Almost everything discussed with Java is same with C++ but usually Python program is 10 to 15 times smaller when compared with C++ Program.

****VS C****\
In simplified language, there is ease of development in Python when compared with C. Also this comparsion is similar to Python VS Java and C++.


# Installing Python
- [Windows](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.1/python-3.11.1-amd64.exe) ⚠️Note that Python 3.9+ cannot be used on Windows 7 or earlier.
- [macOS](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.1/python-3.11.1-macos11.pkg)
- [Other OS](https://www.python.org/download/other/)

# IDE(s) for Python
Virtual Studio Code aka VSCode
- [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=win32-x64-user) ⚠️ windows 8 and above only.
- [macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=darwin-universal)
- [Linux .deb](https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=linux-deb-x64)
- [Linux .rpm](https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=linux-rpm-x64)

PyCharm by JETBRAINS
- [Windows](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows)
- [macOS .dmg intel](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=mac)
- [macOS .dmg silicon](https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-professional-2022.3.1-aarch64.dmg)
- [Linux](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=linux)

Above are some of good ide(s) in which you can code python on. I personally use PyCharm more because it's UI is so simple, I mean VSCode UI is good too but for some reason I prefer PyCharm.

# Python Syntax
**Python Indentation**\
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.\
Important in Python.\
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

**Python Variables**\
Declaring variables in Python? It is easy. Python Variable does not needs to define the data type or such like in some programming language.

We have to always keep the variable name in string, it should not be any special character or any integer.
You can check how to use variables from [here](https://github.com/peacekeeper09/Learn-Python/blob/main/variables.py).

You should keep a note that variable is case sensitive. Example [here](https://github.com/peacekeeper09/Learn-Python/blob/main/case%20sensitive-variable.py).

# Comments in Python

You can simply add up a comment in Python by using #, example [here](https://github.com/peacekeeper09/Learn-Python/blob/main/comment.py).\
Adding up a comment in a program makes it user friendly and actually allows you or your fellow worker to understand the code easily when you are accessing it later for rewriting the code or updating some feature.
