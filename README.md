# Learn Python - A simplified documentation on Python.

Hello folks, you can call me PEACE. As you can see the heading, this is an unofficial, simplified documentation for Python, for beginners. In this repository, I have tried to explain Python as simple as possible. So without wasting any more time, let's begin!

## Python
**What is Python ?** 

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. In sort, it's an easy programming language that one can learn. It's readability is way better as compared to any other programming language out there. Also the Python community is so helpful, healthy and active. You can get to know more about "Python" from [here](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/). I believe this is all you need to know about Python(summary ofc) but feel free to give it a visit.
